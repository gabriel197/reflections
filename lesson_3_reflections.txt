1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--This will be useful when working with more people on the same project or if you have 
multiple computers

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--If you work with others, there will be too much code bundled;

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
--Fork create a copy of the repository on GitHub servers while "clone" make it from GitHub
to your local machine or from local to another local. Branches start from a commit on 
master and create new pathways that can be merged at the end.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--You can work on project no matter if you have internet connection or not, while working 
with someone, by fetching the repository and getting new different commits, you can merge
them with your local one

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?
--Would be easier only if we are together in the same room, otherwise everything will be
not necessary harder more like time consuming

6.When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
--When is a feature to implement that might have some bugs and you'll want a pull request
on that, it might be a good ideea to use a separate branch & also when multiple people are
working on the same project. Otherwise if you are woking alone on repository, it's ok to make
the changes directly to master, it's less time consuming
