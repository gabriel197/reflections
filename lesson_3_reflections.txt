1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--This will be useful when working with more people on the same project or if you have 
multiple computers

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--If you work with others, there will be too much code bundled;

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
--Fork create a copy of the repository on GitHub servers while "clone" make it from GitHub
to your local machine or from local to another local. Branches start from a commit on 
master and create new pathways that can be merged at the end.
