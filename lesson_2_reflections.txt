1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--An empty Git repository is created, i need it in order to make commits to
my files

2. How is the stagin area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
--The repository itself is the file witch contains my commits, working directory
contains the actual files and the staging area is where we choose what files
will go into our commits.It offers the possibility to add or remove files from
our next commit.
