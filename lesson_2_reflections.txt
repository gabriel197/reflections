--An empty Git repository is created, i need it in order to make commits to
my files.

2. How is the stagin area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
--The repository itself is the file witch contains my commits, working directory
contains the actual files and the staging area is where we choose what files
will go into our commits.It offers the possibility to add or remove files from
our next commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
--After i make a logical change in code, i will use the staging area to add that
change to my current commit and then create it with a specific description.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organinzed? How would branches help?
--When implementing a new feature, a branch would be very helpful, you can work 
on that until it's perfect and then add it to the rest of your code.
